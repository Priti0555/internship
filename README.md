# Internship Project - She Can Foundation

Created by: Priti Routhan  
Organization: She Can Foundation  
Type: Dummy Internship Project  

## Project Overview

This is a simple internship project made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

# What it does:
- There's a Login Page where a dummy user can log in.
- After logging in, a *Dashboard* opens.
- The Dashboard shows:
  - Username
  - Referral Number
  - Amount Raised

All this information is added manually in the backend (MySQL database) and is shown on the frontend using *PHP*.

##  Files in the Project

- login.html – Page where the user logs in  
- dashboard.html – Page that shows user info  
- data.php – Gets data from the database  
- internship.sql – Database file with table and data  

##  How to Run

1. Install XAMPP or any local server.
2. Copy this project folder into the htdocs folder (like C:\xampp\htdocs\internship).
3. Open phpMyAdmin and import the internship.sql file into a database.
4. Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
5. Open your browser and go to:  
   http://localhost/internship/login.html

  Note
This is a *dummy project* made during an internship, to show how data from the backend can be displayed on a webpage.
